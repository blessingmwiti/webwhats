# Webwhats

A Kotlin App that renders WhatsApp webview as an app

## Reason for developing this project

I have 2 phones, and wanted to use the same WhatsApp account in both phones, there are apps available, but are filled 
with ads, privacy concerns and some need payment.

That's when I thought, why not create one, and make it open source
